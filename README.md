# RPGProject

This is a fun project for one of the courses I was using to learn C++. 

The course is in udemy called The Complete C++ developer course.

The information about the project can be found in the attached pdf.

(Please do not judge me to hard for my C++ skills, just started with the language some weeks ago)
